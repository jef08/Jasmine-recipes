        <p>This recipe can make one large pizza or two (or more) smaller pizzas, depending on how small you want them to be.</p>
        <p>Here are the ingredientes you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups of flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of warm water</li>
            <li>1 packet of rapid rise yeast</li>
            <li>1tbs of salt</li>
            <li>1/2tbs of sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Have you got all your ingredients? Great! Let's get started.</p>
        <p>Here are the instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First we want to get our warm water, mix in the sugar and let it dissolve.</li>
            <li>Put in your packet of rapid rise yeast, give it a quick stir, and leave it for a couple minutes until it's frothy.</li>
            <li>At this point you want to mix in 3 cups of the flour, along with the salt and olive oil.</li>
            <li>Mix the dough well, if it's very sticky, add more flour little by little </li>
            <li>Once the mixture is smooth, take it out and kneed it for a couple of minutes, making sure everything is completely mixed.</li>
            <li>Put the kneeded dough into a oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise until it's about double in size.</li>
            <li>Once it's risen, shape the dough to the size you want, and put on the ingredients you want! (Alternatively, leave in the fridge for up to 3 days)</li>
            <li>Bake at about 400 degrees farenheit (220 celsius).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It's as simple as that!  I hope you enjoyed this recipe and the pizza you got to make with it.</p>
        <p>Until next time!</p>
